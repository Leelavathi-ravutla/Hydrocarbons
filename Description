The main desire of this project aims to provide the standard quality and usage of the water based on the level of hydrocarbons 
present in the water. The main objective is to design, develop and to implement quality based water by monitoring the water levels 
based on the purposes like household, irrigation and in water tanks by using the specialized hydrocarbon sensors will help us to detect.  
Here the quality level can be measured based on the turbidity, conductance, PH, temperature, and the dissolved oxygen involved in the water. 
This quality-based water monitoring system ensures to prevent the potential threats caused due to the accidental sewage and leaks or farm 
release into portable water.
